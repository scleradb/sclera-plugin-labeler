# Sclera - Row Labeler

Labels data rows based on predicates provided. This labeling results in the data stream being viewed as a label stream, enabling regular expression matching over the streaming data. This is a powerful construct, unique to Sclera, and enables computations that are ridiculously hard to express and expensive to compute using standard SQL.

For details and examples on using these constructs in a SQL query, please refer to the [ScleraSQL Reference](https://www.scleradb.com/docs/sclerasql/sqlextordered/) document.
